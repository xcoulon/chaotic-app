# Chaotic App

A tiy application based on [fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) to experiment with [Prometheus Blackbox Exporter]()

This application exposes 3 endpoints:

- `/hello`: always returns a `200 OK` response with a nice "Hello, World ðŸ‘‹!" message
- `/_heatlh/ready`: always returns a `200 OK` response
- `/_heatlh/alive`: randomly returns a `200 OK` response or a `500 Internal Server Error` response

Run the following command (requires [task](https://taskfile.dev/)) to build and push to quay.io (make sure you update the repository when building and pushing the image, first!):
